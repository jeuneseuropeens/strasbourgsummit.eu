title: "Conférence From Regional Integration towards a World Federation"
excerpt: "The conclusions given by the Conference on the Future of Europe signal towards a further European political integration, and even towards a European Federation. However, would that be the last step considering that we face problems which go well beyond our borders?
Is the UN enough to solve, for instance, the current climate crisis? Maybe we should envision a different model, maybe we should go well beyond the current state of world politics?"
