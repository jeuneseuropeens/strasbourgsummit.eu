To date, the timetable and the ways in which aspirations will be taken into account remain uncertain. Furthermore, the unsuccessful follow-up to previous citizens' consultations in Europe gives little hope that the proposals made in the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe will be taken into consideration.</p><p>Indeed, although European citizens have been given the floor many times to express their expectations, their contributions have often remained in the form of reports. <bold>Let's not let our words go unheard once again!</bold></p><p>Far from resigning, European civil society therefore wishes to mobilise so that this moment of democracy does not remain without follow-up. The conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe in May 2022 are <bold>a unique opportunity for civil society to define the Europe it wants</bold> and for European leaders to translate it into action. <bold>The Strasbourg Summit on 5-8 May 2022 will push for it</bold> with all European civil society organisations.</p><p><bold>Expectations are high.</bold> The Conference on the Future of Europe can lead to a sincere and in-depth reform carried out by the European institutions and involving its citizens, in particular the youngest. It can also bring about the changes that will <bold>give Europe the capacity to meet the challenges of our century</bold>, which concern us all, first and foremost climate change.</p>"
