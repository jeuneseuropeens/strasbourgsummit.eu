        "text": "<p>Since May 9, 2021, all European citizens have been called upon to take part in the <bold>Conference on the Future of Europe</bold> to debate Europe's priorities and reflect on the future they wish to give it.</p><p>While this major debate is a unique opportunity to re-found Europe, there are a number of worrying signs as to what will actually happen. To date, the timetable and the ways in which aspirations will be taken into account remain uncertain. Furthermore, the unsuccessful follow-up to previous citizens' consultations in Europe gives little hope that the proposals made in the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe will be taken into consideration.</p><p>Indeed, although European citizens have been given the floor many times to express their expectations, their contributions have often remained in the form of reports. <bold>Let's not let our words go unheard once again!</bold></p><p>Far from resigning, European civil society therefore wishes to mobilise so that this moment of democracy does not remain without follow-up. The conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe in May 2022 are <bold>a unique opportunity for civil society to define the Europe it wants</bold> and for European leaders to translate it into action. <bold>The Strasbourg Summit on 5-8 May 2022 will push for it</bold> with all European civil society organisations.</p><p><bold>Expectations are high.</bold> The Conference on the Future of Europe can lead to a sincere and in-depth reform carried out by the European institutions and involving its citizens, in particular the youngest. It can also bring about the changes that will <bold>give Europe the capacity to meet the challenges of our century</bold>, which concern us all, first and foremost climate change.</p>"
